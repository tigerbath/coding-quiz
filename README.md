# Project brief & notes

I have been tasked to create a timed coding quiz to help test the users knowledge on coding related questions. When the user starts, a timer starts to count down, if they answer correctly, more time is added, if they answer incorrectly time is taken away. The user has the option to save their score on a leaderboard page provided.

## What i've done

A coding question based game designed to test those learning the fundamentals of JavaScript. This quiz game features questions with limited time response times, if the user gets the question correct, the timer will reset and go onto the next. If the user gets the question wrong, a game over screen is presented. User scores are presented as a leaderboard at the end.
